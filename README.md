# K Auctions

_⚠️This is an experimental addon and is a heavy work in progress_

This addon is still in its infancy and under active development. Right now, it's a bare bones placeholder. It's enough to prove the concept and get the update pipeline flowing, but over time, it will evolve into a fully featured tool that:
- Pulls live auction house data for multiple realms
- Builds an in game price database
- Delivers dynamic configuration to fine tune how data is displayed in your UI

What to Expect Now
- Limited or placeholder functionality
- Rapid updates as core systems are implemented
- Features may appear, break, or change without warning

What's Coming Later
- Smarter auction price tracking
- More customization for data views
- Polished UI integration

If you enjoy testing bleeding‑edge builds and don't mind the occasional rough edge, your feedback now can help shape the final experience.
